# React JS

## Set Up

1. Install the chrome extension: react developer tools. This extension allows you to see all the components and states in the inspect section of the browser.

2. Make sure you have npm installed (^5.2.0 to use npx)

```bash
npm --version
```

3. Type on the directory were you want a react app:

```bash
npx create-react-app [app_name]
```

This will create your directoy with name [app_name] by running locally create-react-app inside that folder.

4. Open the folder with your text editor.

## Run

- This command will start the server locally

```bash
npm start
```

- This command will build our static assets for deployment: all your components and all will be built and this you upload for production. You can delete all your component source files and the folder created will still work.

```bash
npm run build
```
